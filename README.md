# Medical Appointment No-Show Predictor

A real-world machine learning project that predicts whether a patient will miss a medical appointment based on demographic and behavioral data.

## Problem
Missed medical appointments cause resource waste and longer wait times. This project helps healthcare providers predict no-shows in advance.

## Features
- End-to-end ML pipeline
- Feature engineering on scheduling behavior
- Classification model optimized for healthcare use
- Production-ready project structure

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train the model:
   python train.py

3. Make a prediction:
   python predict.py

## Output
- Trained model saved in `model/`
- Classification report printed after training

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Use Cases
- Hospital scheduling optimization
- Healthcare analytics
- Predictive decision support
